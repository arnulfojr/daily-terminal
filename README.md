# daily-terminal
This is my personal set up for tmux and vim.

## Brief introduction
This includes some dependencies managed by tpm and Vundle plugin managers for each of these components.

## Aware
So this is my configuration and this are my preferences you're free to take this as a base and extend or recommend different configurations, therefore this type of license attached in the repo.

## Dependencies
This set up is meant for macOS but works just fine with Linux Systems

* tmux-mem-cpu-load, I got it installed with homebrew, therefore is not set up as a tmux plugin dependency.
* tree, also installed via homebrew.
* (tpm)[https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm]
* (Vundle)[https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim]
