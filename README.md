# daily-terminal
This is my personal set up for tmux and vim. I tend to keep the default's key bindings, so is not only easier for you to reuse the configuration and adapt it to your key bindings of preference but I don't lose track of all the keys in the docs :)

## Brief introduction
This includes some dependencies managed by tpm and Vundle plugin managers for each of these components.

## Aware
This is my personal configuration for my Terminal and there are my personal preferences. You're free to take this as a base and extend or recommend different configuartions.

## Dependencies
This set up is meant for macOS but works just fine with Linux Systems

* tmux-mem-cpu-load, I got it installed with homebrew, therefore is not set up as a tmux plugin dependency.
* tree, also installed via homebrew.
* tmux plugin manager: [tpm](https://github.com/tmux-plugins/tpm)
* Plugin Manager for vim: [Vundle](https://github.com/VundleVim/Vundle.vim)
* For better fonts and icons refer to [nerd-fonts](https://github.com/ryanoasis/nerd-fonts)
* Personally, I like the best the Ubuntu font the best but here's a list of the fonts I find good.
  + Ubuntu Mono Nerd Font
  + Mononoki Nerd Font
  + FuraCode Nerd Font

> I personally do not like font ligatures but up to you

# Usage
